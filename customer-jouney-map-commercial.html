            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The commercial lines area of a property and casualty insurance company wanted to develop more systematic knowledge of how the commercial agents experience the whole process of quoting and binding new policies with the company. They also wanted to identify any areas of weakness in the current process. I was contacted by the leadership to help them understand how agents experience the process. </p>
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>I worked with the Commercial Lines area to conduct customer journey mapping of agents' experiences from the time they send applications for new business to the time the business is issued. Customer journey mapping is a technique that allows a company to develop knowledge about customers’ experiences as they move through a process. I used process guidance from NN/g to conduct internal and external interviews to develop a customer journey map. First, I interviewed four commercial lines underwriters and developed an assumption customer journey map. The assumption-based map gathered our internal understanding of the process. Second, I interviewed 12 external participants and developed a research-based customer journey map. </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The research-based customer journey map found that participants think highly of the application process and underwriters but there are numerous opportunities to improve the process. Areas to consider additional work are listed below: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase participants’ opportunities to quote online</li>
                <li>Improve the speed of data input into the systems</li>
                <li>Provide quick quotes for more lines of business</li>
                <li>Provide comprehensive multiline proposals in clear language, with line specific details</li>
                <li>Provide quicker access to policy numbers and ID cards </li>
                <li>Provide ability to bind all policies with one action</li>
                <li>Provide option to bill the customer for the down payment </li>
            </ul>
                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>The customer journey mapping provided leadership with information about the process and potential improvements to it. This is another example of how I implemented an internal process to help improve or “mature” the UX function within the company.</p>
