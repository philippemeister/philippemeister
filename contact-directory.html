            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A property and casualty insurance company provides a company contact directory to independent insurance agents. Independent agents use the directory to find various people within the company. The previous contact directory provided lists of names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Agents reported difficulties using the contact directory to find people. A small project was started to enhance the contact directory.</p>
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>Five steps were conducted to complete the work:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Gather input from users and other sources about the existing contact directory</li>
    <li>Compare the existing contact directory with other contact directories</li>
    <li>Create mockups for a new contact directory</li>
    <li>Review mockups with stakeholders</li>
    <li>User test the mockups or an early version of the system with agents</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The design covers agents' three primary tasks when they are seeking contact information:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find contact information for a person they know they should contact in a given situation. When an agent does this, they are often finding information for the contact person for their writing territory. To support agents in this task, the new interface provides a "my contact" label on their territory contacts and enables them to  access a list of their territory contacts.</li>
                    <li>Figure out who to contact in a given situation. When an agent does this, they are often seraching by speciality. To support agents in this task, the new interace allows them to search and filter all contacts by speciality.</li>
                    <li>Contact somebody else when the person they are trying to contact is unavailable. When an agent does this, they are often looking for team members or a manager. To support agents in this task, the new interface provides a profile page for each person. This profile pages lists out who the person reports to, who is on their team, and who reports to this person.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The design has not been reviewed with stakeholders or tested with users. The results can be reported at a later date.</p>
